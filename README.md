Instagram Story Archive Bulk Deleter
A simple, browser-based script to help you bulk-delete stories from your Instagram archive. This tool injects a clean, easy-to-use UI directly onto the Instagram archive page, allowing you to visually select and delete multiple stories at once without needing to install any browser extensions or provide your login credentials to a third party.

‚ú® Features
No Installation Needed: Runs entirely in your browser's developer console.

Secure: Your password, cookies, and account credentials are never exposed to the script directly. All actions are performed locally in your browser.

Visual Selection: Displays story thumbnails in a grid, so you know exactly which stories you are deleting.

Bulk Actions: Includes "Select All" and "Deselect All" buttons for efficient management.

Safe & Cautious: A built-in randomized delay between each deletion request helps prevent your account from being flagged or temporarily restricted by Instagram.

Re-openable UI: Injects a small launcher button on the page so you can easily open and close the deleter panel without needing to re-run the script.

üöÄ How to Use
Navigate to your Archive: Log in to your Instagram account and go to your Story Archive.

Use at your own risk. The author is not responsible for any data loss, account restrictions, or any other issues that may arise from using this script.

Recently Deleted Folder: This script moves stories to your "Recently Deleted" folder. From there, they are permanently deleted by Instagram after 30 days. You can restore them from that folder within the 30-day window.

Rate-Limiting: While the script has a built-in delay, deleting a very large number of stories in a short period could still be flagged by Instagram's systems. It's recommended to use this tool moderately.
